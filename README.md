Averaging noisy data into bins

The Matlab function binAveraging allows clearer visualization of power spectral density estimates of turbulent velocity density by smoothing the high-frequency range. It can also be used to average data into no-overlapping bins.

The present submission contains:

    the function binAveraging.m
    An example file Example.mlx
    A data set PSD_velocity.mat which contains a time series of simulated turbulent velocity fluctuations
